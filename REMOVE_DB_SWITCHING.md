# Database Switching Removal

## Changes Made

The database switching functionality has been removed from the app to simplify the codebase and focus on Supabase as the primary database. The following changes were made:

1. **Simplified DatabaseContext**
   - Removed the database switching logic and UI components
   - Removed the Firebase connection management code
   - Streamlined to use only Supabase as the data source
   - Maintained the same interface for other components

2. **Updated HomeScreen**
   - Removed the database switcher component
   - Kept the database testing tool for development purposes
   - Simplified UI without database toggle

3. **Simplified DataContext**
   - Removed conditional logic for Firebase vs. Supabase
   - Standardized on Supabase for data fetching
   - Maintained the same polling approach for data updates

4. **Removed DatabaseSwitcher Component**
   - Removed the component entirely as it's no longer needed

## Why This Change

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies the codebase by removing complicated switching logic
2. **Focused Development**: Allows focusing on one database technology (Supabase) for production
3. **Reduced Risk**: Eliminates potential issues when switching between databases
4. **Cleaner UI**: Removes developer-focused UI elements from the production app

## Firebase Status

All Firebase integration work has been preserved in the codebase:

- Firebase configuration and services remain in place
- Database connection and query code is still available
- Migration scripts still work for future reference
- Testing scripts for Firebase functionality are preserved

This allows for potentially reintroducing Firebase in the future if needed.

## Next Steps

1. Review and test the app to ensure everything works correctly with Supabase
2. Remove any unnecessary Firebase-specific code that isn't needed for the current application
3. Continue improving the inventory peptide display and dose count visualization
