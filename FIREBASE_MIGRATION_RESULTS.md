# Firebase Migration Results

## Migration Status Summary

We've successfully implemented the Firebase migration with the following components:

1. **Firebase Schema Design**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created `/src/types/firebase.ts` with proper Firestore data types
   - Designed schema for peptides, inventory, and other collections
   - Implemented support for Firestore Timestamps

2. **Migration Scripts**: ✅ COMPLETED 
   - Created `/scripts/admin-migrate-to-firebase.js` using Firebase Admin SDK
   - Fixed storage bucket URL and added Timestamp support
   - Created data transformation functions for all collections
   - Added data cleaning to prevent null field errors

3. **Data Export**: ✅ COMPLETED
   - Successfully exported all data from Supabase
   - Properly formatted JSON backup saved to `/backups/migration/`
   - All peptides, vials, dose logs, and inventory data included

4. **Data Import to Firebase**: ⚠️ NEED SERVICE ACCOUNT
   - Firebase security rules have been properly configured
   - Need to set up Firebase Admin SDK service account
   - New script created that uses Admin SDK for proper authentication

## Firebase Configuration

The Firebase configuration has been correctly updated:
```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyAMnokBM7CVDE265ZLhZROjWrQ5w2DR2P0",
  authDomain: "peptidepal.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "peptidepal", 
  storageBucket: "peptidepal.appspot.com", // Correct bucket URL
  messagingSenderId: "229078698562",
  appId: "1:229078698562:web:a3a431131daad253b7fbdb"
};
```

The Firebase security rules are already properly configured to allow read and write operations:
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.time < timestamp.date(2025, 6, 10);
    }
  }
}
```

## Admin SDK Setup

To complete the migration, you'll need to set up the Firebase Admin SDK:

1. **Generate a Service Account Key**:
   - Follow the instructions in `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Save the service account key file to your project

2. **Run the Admin Migration Script**:
   - After setting up the service account, run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/admin-migrate-to-firebase.js
   ```

We've also added:
- Proper `.gitignore` entries for the service account key
- Enhanced batch processing for large data imports
- Timestamp conversion for all date fields

## Next Steps

1. **Get Firebase Service Account Key**:
   - Follow the instructions in `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Place the key file in your project directory

2. **Run the Admin Migration Script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/admin-migrate-to-firebase.js
   ```

3. **Test the App with Firebase**:
   - Toggle to Firebase using the Database Switcher
   - Verify that peptides and inventory data appear correctly
   - Test adding a new dose log

4. **Switch to Firebase by Default** (Optional):
   - When ready, update `/src/contexts/DatabaseContext.tsx` to use Firebase by default
   - Set the `const [useFirebase, setUseFirebase] = useState<boolean>(true);` 

## Troubleshooting Tips

If you continue to encounter Firebase connection issues:

1. **Network Issues**:
   - The app includes robust error handling for network issues
   - You can manually reset the connection using the DatabaseSwitcher info panel
   - The app has automatic error detection and periodic connection reset

2. **Firebase Console Errors**:
   - Check the Firebase Console for any error logs
   - Verify that your project is on the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan if you need external network access

3. **Service Account**:
   - Ensure the service account has the necessary permissions
   - Try regenerating the service account key if issues persist

## Data Safety

All your data is safe in Supabase. The migration process is non-destructive and allows you to:
- Continue using Supabase while testing Firebase
- Switch back to Supabase if needed
- Keep both databases in sync during the transition period

The Firebase migration is designed to be seamless and risk-free, with your Supabase data preserved throughout the process.
