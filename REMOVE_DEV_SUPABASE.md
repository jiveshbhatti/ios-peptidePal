# Removal of Supabase Development Database Switching

## Changes Made

The app has been modified to remove the Supabase development/production database switching functionality while preserving the Firebase/Supabase database switching capability:

1. **Modified ColumnTestingTool**
   - Removed references to dev/prod Supabase databases
   - Simplified the UI to just show "Database: Supabase" without showing the development/production label
   - Testing tool still works correctly with the main Supabase database

2. **Firebase/Supabase Switching Preserved**
   - The ability to switch between Firebase and Supabase is still fully functional
   - The DatabaseSwitcher component remains unchanged
   - All Firebase connection logic is preserved

## Why This Change

1. **Simpler Configuration**: Eliminates the need to maintain two separate Supabase databases
2. **Reduced Complexity**: The app now has a clearer database strategy - either Supabase (production) or Firebase
3. **Better Testing**: Testing can be done directly against the production Supabase database or Firebase
4. **More Reliable Development**: Eliminates issues related to data inconsistencies between dev/prod Supabase databases

## Next Steps

1. The configuration files in `src/config.ts` still contain the dev/prod Supabase database switching code, but it's no longer used by the UI.
2. In a future update, we can further simplify by removing the unused configuration code.
3. Focus should now be on ensuring Firebase migration is complete and reliable.
