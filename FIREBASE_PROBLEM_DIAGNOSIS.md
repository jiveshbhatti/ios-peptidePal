# Firebase Problem Diagnosis

## Current Issues

1. **NOT_FOUND Error on Write Attempts**
   - Consistently receiving `Code: 5 Message: 5 NOT_FOUND` errors when trying to write to Firestore
   - This occurs in both authenticated and unauthenticated write attempts

2. **Offline Mode Error**
   - Firestore reports: `Could not reach Cloud Firestore backend. Connection failed`
   - The client is operating in offline mode

3. **Authentication Error**
   - When trying to use email/password auth: `FirebaseError: Firebase: Error (auth/operation-not-allowed)`
   - This suggests email/password auth is not enabled in the Firebase project

## Potential Causes

1. **Firebase Project Configuration**
   - The Firebase project ID "peptidepal" may not be accessible or may not exist
   - Firestore may not be enabled for this project

2. **Network Issues**
   - Possible network restrictions (firewall, proxy, etc.)
   - DNS issues preventing connection to Firebase

3. **Authentication Settings**
   - Email/password authentication is not enabled in the Firebase project
   - No test user has been created

4. **Project Region Mismatch**
   - The specified region in the code might not match the actual Firestore database region

## Required Actions

1. **Verify Project Existence**
   - Confirm that the Firebase project "peptidepal" exists and is accessible
   - Check that the Firebase API key and other credentials are correct

2. **Check Firestore Setup**
   - Ensure Firestore is enabled for this project
   - Verify that a Firestore database has been created
   - Check if the Firestore database is in Native or Datastore mode

3. **Verify Network Access**
   - Test network connectivity to Firebase domains
   - Ensure no firewalls or proxies are blocking the connection

4. **Check Authentication Setup**
   - Enable Email/Password authentication in the Firebase console
   - Create a test user in Firebase Authentication

5. **Service Account**
   - Generate a Firebase Admin SDK service account key
   - Use the Admin SDK to bypass normal authentication

## Next Steps

1. **Generate Service Account Key**
   - Follow the instructions in `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Place the key file at the project root

2. **Run Admin Script with Service Account**
   - Run the admin migration script once the service account is set up

3. **Check Firebase Console**
   - Verify project settings, Firestore status, and security rules

4. **Enable Email/Password Authentication**
   - Go to the Firebase console -> Authentication -> Sign-in methods
   - Enable Email/Password authentication
   - Create a test user

These steps will help determine the exact cause of the problem. The "NOT_FOUND" errors typically indicate that the Firestore database doesn't exist or can't be accessed with the current credentials.
