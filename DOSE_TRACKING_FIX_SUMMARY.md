# Dose Tracking Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Inconsistent Dose Calculations
**Problem**: The Inventory screen and Schedule screen were showing different remaining dose counts for the same peptide.
- Inventory screen was using a hack with the `batch_number` field to track usage
- Schedule screen was using the vial's `remainingAmountUnits`
- No synchronization between these two systems

**Solution**: 
- Created a centralized dose calculation utility (`/src/utils/dose-calculations.ts`) that:
  - Provides a single source of truth for dose calculations
  - Handles both Peptide vial data and InventoryPeptide tracking data
  - Gracefully falls back between the two systems
  - Formats dose display consistently

### 2. Enhanced Swipe-to-Log Visual Feedback
**Problem**: The swipe-to-log gesture needed more prominent visual feedback to make it clear when the action would be triggered.

**Solution**: Enhanced the SwipeablePeptideCard with:
- **Progressive visual feedback**: Added opacity animation that increases as you swipe
- **Glow effect**: Added an animated shadow/glow that intensifies as you approach the activation threshold
- **Larger icons**: Increased icon size from 28 to 32 pixels
- **Bold text**: Made the "LOG DOSE" text bold and uppercase for better visibility
- **Multi-stage haptics**: 
  - Light haptic at 30% swipe progress
  - Medium haptic at 70% progress
  - Heavy haptic when action is triggered
- **Better physics**: Adjusted friction settings for a more responsive feel

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`/src/utils/dose-calculations.ts`** (NEW)
   - Central utility for all dose calculations
   - Exports: `calculateRemainingDoses()`, `calculateUsedDoses()`, `calculateTotalDosesPerVial()`, `formatDoseDisplay()`

2. **`/src/components/SwipeablePeptideCard.tsx`**
   - Updated to use centralized dose calculations
   - Enhanced visual feedback with glow effect
   - Added multi-stage haptic feedback
   - Improved swipe physics

3. **`/src/components/PeptideCard.tsx`**
   - Updated to use centralized dose calculations
   - Consistent dose display format

4. **`/src/components/inventory/InventoryPeptideCard.tsx`**
   - Updated to accept optional `schedulePeptide` prop
   - Uses centralized dose calculations
   - Simplified dose tracking logic

5. **`/src/screens/InventoryScreen.tsx`**
   - Now passes associated Peptide data to InventoryPeptideCard
   - Ensures accurate dose tracking

6. **`/src/services/peptide.service.adaptive.ts`**
   - Added automatic sync of dose count to inventory when logging/reverting doses
   - Ensures both systems stay in sync

7. **`/src/utils/haptics.ts`**
   - Added missing haptic methods: `impactMedium()`, `impactHeavy()`, `selection()`

### Migration Script

Created `/scripts/sync-dose-tracking.js` to:
- Sync existing dose log counts to the inventory tracking system
- Fix any mismatches between the two systems
- Initialize tracking for peptides that don't have it

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify dose count consistency**:
   - Check that the same peptide shows identical dose counts on both Inventory and Schedule screens
   - Log a dose and verify both screens update correctly
   - Revert a dose and verify both screens update correctly

2. **Test enhanced swipe feedback**:
   - Swipe slowly to see the progressive visual feedback
   - Notice the glow effect intensifying as you swipe further
   - Feel the haptic feedback at different stages
   - Verify the larger, bolder text is more visible

3. **Run the sync script** (if needed):
   ```bash
   cd ios-peptidepal
   node scripts/sync-dose-tracking.js
   ```

## Future Improvements

1. **Remove the batch_number hack**: Once we're confident the vial tracking is working correctly, we should remove the temporary usage tracking from the batch_number field.

2. **Add visual swipe indicator**: Consider adding a small animated arrow or hint for first-time users to discover the swipe gesture.

3. **Persist swipe state**: Consider saving whether a user has discovered the swipe gesture to hide hints after first use.
