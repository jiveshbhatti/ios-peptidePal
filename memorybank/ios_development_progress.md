# PeptidePal iOS Development Progress

## Project Setup âœ…
- [x] Initialize React Native Expo project with TypeScript
- [x] Configure git repository and push to GitHub
- [x] Install core dependencies (Supabase, Navigation, UI libraries)
- [x] Configure app.json for iOS development
- [x] Set up EAS configuration for TestFlight deployment
- [x] Copy type definitions from web app
- [x] Set up Supabase client with same credentials as web app
- [x] Create folder structure for organized development

## Current Status
- Project initialized with React Native Expo
- Basic folder structure created
- Dependencies installed
- Git repository configured
- Type definitions copied from web app

## Next Steps
1. Create basic navigation structure
2. Implement authentication flow
3. Create main screens (Calendar, Inventory, Calculator, Summary)
4. Port UI components from web app
5. Implement data services
6. Add real-time synchronization
7. Test on iOS simulator and devices
8. Build for TestFlight

## Notes
- Using same Supabase instance as web app for data consistency
- Maintaining feature parity with web application
- Focus on iOS-native user experience
- TypeScript for type safety
