# Firebase Migration Complete

## Migration Summary (Completed January 2025)

### What Was Done
1. **Complete Migration from Supabase to Firebase**
   - Migrated all data models to Firestore
   - Implemented real-time listeners for all collections
   - Removed all Supabase dependencies
   - Updated all services to use Firebase SDK

2. **Data Structure in Firestore**
   ```
   peptides/
     {peptideId}/
       - All peptide data
       - vials[] array
       - doseLogs[] array
   
   inventory/
     peptides/
       {peptideId}/
         - Inventory data
         - Stock tracking
         - Default schedules
   ```

3. **Key Technical Changes**
   - Replaced Supabase client with Firebase client
   - Changed from SQL queries to Firestore document queries
   - Implemented Firebase real-time listeners instead of polling
   - Updated all TypeScript types for Firebase data

4. **Service Updates**
   - `firebase-clean.js`: Core Firebase service with all CRUD operations
   - `firebase-wrapper.ts`: TypeScript wrapper for type safety
   - `firebase-realtime.ts`: Real-time subscription management
   - Removed all Supabase service files

5. **Features Maintained**
   - All existing functionality preserved
   - Real-time sync across devices
   - No authentication (single-user mode)
   - Inventory-centric architecture

### Benefits of Firebase
- Better offline support
- Automatic caching
- Simpler real-time updates
- No need for separate database setup
- Better integration with mobile apps

### Configuration
- Firebase config stored in `firebase-config.js`
- No environment variables needed (single-user app)
- Firestore security rules allow all access (no auth)

### Removed Files
- All Supabase-related services
- Database migration scripts
- SQL schema files
- Supabase configuration files

## Current State
The app is now fully running on Firebase with all features working:
- ✅ Peptide management
- ✅ Inventory tracking
- ✅ Dose logging
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Vial lifecycle management
- ✅ Data persistence
